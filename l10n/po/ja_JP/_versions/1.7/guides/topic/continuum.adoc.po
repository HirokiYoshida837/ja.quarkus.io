msgid "For years, the client-server architecture has been the de-facto standard to build applications.  But a major shift happened.  The _one model rules them all_ age is over.  A new range of applications and architecture styles has emerged and impacts how code is written and how applications are deployed and executed.  HTTP microservices, reactive applications, message-driven microservices and serverless are now central players in modern systems."
