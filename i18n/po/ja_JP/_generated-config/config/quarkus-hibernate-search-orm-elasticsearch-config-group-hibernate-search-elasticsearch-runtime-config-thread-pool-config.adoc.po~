"The size of the thread pool assigned to the backend. \n"
" Note that number is *per backend*, not per index. Adding more indexes will "
"not add more threads. \n"
" As all operations happening in this thread-pool are non-blocking, raising "
"its size above the number of processor cores available to the JVM will not "
"bring noticeable performance benefit. The only reason to alter this setting "
"would be to reduce the number of threads; for example, in an application "
"with a single index with a single indexing queue, running on a machine with "
"64 processor cores, you might want to bring down the number of threads. \n"
" Defaults to the number of processor cores available to the JVM on "
